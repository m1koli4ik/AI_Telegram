# AI Telegram Bot

This project is a Python-based Telegram bot that leverages the Google Gemini API to engage in private conversations. The bot is designed to interact with a specific user, acting as a conversational partner with a unique, pre-defined persona.

## Features

- **Private Conversation**: The bot responds only to messages from a designated Telegram user ID, ensuring private and controlled interactions.
- **AI-Powered**: Utilizes Google's Gemini models for natural language generation.
- **Configurable Persona**: The bot's personality and communication style are fully customizable via an environment variable.
- **Real-time Interaction**: The bot shows a "typing" status while generating a response, providing a more natural conversational experience.

## Getting Started

### Prerequisites

- Python 3.8 or higher
- A Telegram API key (`API_ID` and `API_HASH`) from [my.telegram.org](https://my.telegram.org/)

   # The Gemini model to use
   GEMINI_MODEL="gemma-3n-e4b-it"

   # The core prompt that defines the bot's persona.
   # WARNING: This prompt contains strong language and is configured for a rude, unpunctuated, and aggressive persona.
